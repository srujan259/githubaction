_Steps to test or reproduce_

_Things to consider:_
- Have you registered new classes with Autofac?
- Have updates to sql entities been validated to confirm the updates are applied as expected; did you update the corresponding template?
- Does this change meet the acceptance criteria in the card? Is product approval required?
- Run unit tests when merging any change, even the small ones; check your script numbering and that your database rebuilds
- Are edge cases, unhappy paths, etc. handled well?
- Is this code meaningfully unit tested? Are the manual tests sufficient/appropriate?
- What are the possible side effects or downstream effects of this change?
- Is this the right technical approach to this problem?
